# Syntax Checker for C++

**Language used:** Python

# Overview

This project uses Lex and Yacc, functionalities used for lexical analysis and parsing, to create a parser for 5 constructs in C++. The 5 constructs include input statements, output statements, variable declaration, function declaration and definition and class definition (including the use of access specifiers). The function body can only check syntax for any of the above statements and not for any looping, conditional programming and assignment statement. It also contains a hard-coded sample string with valid and invalid inputs.
